Java Notes:
	AUg 21:
java is a compiled language
all code in Jav goes in a class.
every program has to start execution with a main method.
	Class Meeting 3
control Structures
-if statements
Java only associates one line of code following an If statement, ans anything else needed 
to have brackets to be grouped with the if statement. also- dont use ';' if the if statment 
is still being used.
-while loops
make sure progress is made towards the loop finishing.
-Objects in Java
objects hold data that can be used through methods. Dot notation is how we talk to objects.
never use '==' to compare strings instead use "string.equals("name2")"
-Scanners
a scanner object allows the processing and use of input, and breaks them into tokens
when tokens are items seperated by whitespaceu.
#scanner is imported from "Java.util.scanner;"
".next" returns next token as a string. seems to use a queue. Scanner is a tool for
reading scanner. "Hasnext" returns a boolian, but does not progress a scanner location.
Hasbext should always be used with a next command.
	Class Meeting 4
-String vs. scanner.
not the same___ 
-For LOOPS
java syntax for loop "for(init; continuation; increment)"
example: for(int counter = 1; counter <= 3; counter+1){stuff}
*scope can always go down but cant go up, (you can't use a varible declated inside a for loop outside a for loop)
-Arrays
each item in an array is called an element, and they are 0 indexed in Java. 
example "int[] variableName = new int[5];" or ".. = { 1, 2, 17};
to print an array use "Arrays.toString(arrayName)" 
-Enhanced FOr loop
aka a "for each loop"
syntax: "for(elementType name: arrayRefrence)"
example "
	Class 5?
-Errors
1.Syntax or compiler error
2.Semantic/logic error
3. Runtime error/Eception error
ex. divide by 0, 
-Try/catch
handling exceptions, use "try, and catch" 
-Reading from Files
Scanner objects can be used to read from files.
ex. "
String filename = "sample_text.txt";
File file = new File(filename);
Scanner fielInput = new Scanner(file);
"
-throws
declares that a method may throw an exeption, is a powerful comment type response
that puts the responiblity to watch for errors on someone else.
-Java Doc 
ex "/** blah blah blah */
format is small summary, then "@paramter" and discription 
		Class 6
when swapping two values, three values are needed (temparary value to stop data loss.
ex.
* if switching values in an array only do the first half, that way you dont double swap values
- primative vs. refrence
primative variables hold a value in stack, refrence to stack refrence to a value in heap, (heap and stack memory.)
two ways to make a new array are "new int[]" or {kjadsfhf,dsffjka,dfaasds}
-calling methods
if it is a class in the same package, you can just use class name
if it in a class in a seperate package, use "packageName.className", or use an import at the beginning.
- Unit Testing
normal, edge, and corner cases 
-JUnit
can be added in side bar, leave defaults, and add a name.

	Class 7
"AssertArrayEquals(expectedArray, outputArray)" compares an expected and actual array
--Method overloading
two methods with the same name, but different versions/parameters. 
-OOP
classes and objects, Encpasulation- data is stored in a class and protected from other methods.
different objects make up a class.
**see lecture slides for class and constructor examples and layout.
ex. Person p = new Person();
null means no object has been built yet;
public can be used by anyone, but private can only be used by the class in ehich it has been defined
make any instance variables private to ensure encapsilation.
"getter" and "setter"
calling an instance methos requires an instance of a class
		Class 9?
instance varibles should be set to private (varibles used in class)
classes are useful to put barriors between things. 
use ".equals" to compare two objects
objects can be parameters as well as instance variables
		Class 10
"public static final double PI" is a constant that will never change
2D array, 3X2 array is 3 rows 2 columns
creating " double[][] matrix = new double[2][2];
or ".... = {{1,2},{2,3}};
or matix[2] = double[{2,3}][] to only do one row
